To load json file we use Future builder which takes Default Asset Bundle as future
and builder where builder takes context and snapshot and inside it we decode json
using JSON.decode(snapshot.data.toString) 
and then we pass the data to list view

it is important funtionality in fluttter which is used to change the state from 
current state to new state on callback of some thing like button pressed it is done
only in presence of stateful widget

-> To print the data on screen of a static app
for this we have to make a list or a map 
in case we use list and then we first create constuructor of item we want to create 
then call them in list i.e., constructor and assigin the value to them 
and then map it to which ever widget we want to map with the help of
list_variable_name.map().toList() funtion and then 
return the things in form of appropriate widget where we want to show on screen.
